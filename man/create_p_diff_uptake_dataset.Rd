\arguments{
\item{dat}{data imported by the \code{\link{read_hdx}} function.}

\item{protein}{chosen protein.}

\item{state_1}{biological state for chosen protein. From this state values
the second state values are subtracted to get the deuterium uptake difference.}

\item{state_2}{biological state for chosen protein. This state values are 
subtracted from the first state values to get the deuterium uptake difference.}

\item{p_adjustment_method}{method of adjustment P-values for multiple 
comparisons. Possible methods: "BH" (Benjamini & Hochberg correction), 
"bonferroni" (Bonferroni correction) and "none" (default).}

\item{confidence_level}{confidence level for the t-test.}

\item{time_0}{minimal exchange control time point of measurement [min].}

\item{time_100}{maximal exchange control time point of measurement [min].}

\item{deut_part}{deuterium percentage in solution used in experiment, 
value from range [0, 1].}

\details{
REWRITE!!
The volcano plot shows the deuterium uptake difference in time 
for the peptides. This function prepares data for the plot.
For peptides in all of the time points of measurement (except for minimal
and maximal exchange control) the deuterium uptake difference between state_1
and state_2 is calculated, with its uncertainty (combined and propagated as
described in `Data processing` article). For each peptide in time point the 
P-value is calculated using unpaired t-test - the deuterium uptake difference
is calculated as the difference of measured masses in a given time point for two 
states. The tested hypothesis is that the mean masses for states from the 
replicates of the experiment are similar. The P-values indicates if the null
hypothesis can be rejected - rejection of the hypothesis means that the 
difference between states is statistically significant at provided confidence
level. The P-values can be adjusted using the provided method.
This plot is visible in GUI.
