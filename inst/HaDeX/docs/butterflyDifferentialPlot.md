## Butterfly Differential Plot

Butterfly differential plot shows the deuterium uptake difference between two biological states in the form of a butterfly plot. It shows the results for a peptide ID (peptides are numbered arranged by the start position). The results are shown for different time points at once (time points of measurement are indicated by the color).
