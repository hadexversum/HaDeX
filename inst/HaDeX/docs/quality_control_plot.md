## Quality control

The plot shows the change in the uncertainty of deuteration levels as a function of incubation time. The uncertainty is averaged over all peptides available at a given time point in a selected state. Therefore, the user can detect if the uncertainty of deuteration measurements decreases over time (as expected in the majority of experiments).

Moreover, the user can use this chart to identify a time point after which the decrease of the deuteration uncertainty becomes too marginal to prolong the measurements.
