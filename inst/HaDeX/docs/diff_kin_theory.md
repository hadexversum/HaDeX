## Calculation types

### Theoretical

Measured deuterium uptake is compared with theoretical values - the minimal exchange control is mass of a peptide with only hydrogens, and the maximal exchange control is a mass of a peptide with only deuterons. The correction on D20 concentration is made, based on the value from `Input data` settings. 

Using theoretical values causes the experimental back-exchange information to be lost. The maximal exchange control is the maximal possible based on the sequence (all H exchanged to D), the information about conformation is lost.

### Experimental

Measured deuterium uptake is compared with experimenally measured minimal and maximal exchange control.
