## Chiclet Plot

Chiclet plot shows the fractional deuterium uptake in the form of a heatmap for the peptides in a given biological state. One tile indicates the peptide (identified by its ID - number arranged by the start position) in a time point of measurement. The color of the tile indicates the fractinal deuterium uptake (according to the legend below the plot).
