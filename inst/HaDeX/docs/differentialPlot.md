## Woods Differential Plot

Woods plot presents the deuterium uptake difference between two biological states for the peptides. The results are presented with respect to the length of the peptide and its position in the protein sequence for a given time point of the measurement. The statistical test (Houde et al.), the confidence level is calculated based on the measurements in chosen time point of the measurement) is applied to determine the confidence limits values at the chosen level.
