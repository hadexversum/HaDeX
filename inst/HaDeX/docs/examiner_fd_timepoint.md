## Choose the time point value

Files from HDeXaminer don't provide numerical value of time point 
for fully deuterated sample but flag it as "FD". For preciese values 
on the plots and data, HaDeX needs a numerical value in minutes.
The value (1440 min = 24 h) is commonly used and is suggested, but 
the user can change it to  its true value.
